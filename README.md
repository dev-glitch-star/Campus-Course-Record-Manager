# 🎓 Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

*A beginner-friendly Java application for managing student records, courses, and grades*

Ever wanted to build your own student management system? This project is perfect for Java beginners who want to see how real-world applications come together! CCRM demonstrates core Java concepts through a practical console application that any school or college could actually use.

## 🚀 What Does This Do?

CCRM helps educational institutions manage:
- *Student Records* - Add, view, and update student information
- *Course Catalog* - Manage available courses and their details  
- *Enrollments* - Track which students are taking which courses
- *Grades* - Record and calculate student performance
- *Data Backup* - Keep your records safe with automatic backups

Think of it as a simplified version of systems like Banner or Student Information Systems that universities use, but built to help you learn Java fundamentals!

## 🛠 Quick Start

### What You Need
- *Java 8 or newer* (Java 17+ works great too!)
- An IDE like *Eclipse, **IntelliJ IDEA, or **VS Code*
- Basic understanding of Java (classes, objects, methods)

### Get It Running
1. *Download the code* - Clone this repository or download the ZIP
2. *Set up your project* - Import into your favorite IDE
3. *Add test data* - Place the test-data folder in your project root
4. *Run it* - Execute CCRMApp.java and you're ready to go!

bash
# Verify Java is installed
java -version

# Should show something like:
# java version "17.0.1" 2021-10-19 LTS


## 🎯 Perfect for Learning

This project was designed specifically for students learning Java. Here's what you'll see in action:

### Core Java Concepts
- *Object-Oriented Programming* - Real inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- *File Handling* - Reading from and writing to CSV files
- *Exception Handling* - Proper error management and user-friendly messages
- *Collections* - ArrayList usage for dynamic data storage
- *Enums* - Grade and Semester enums with fields and methods

### Design Patterns
- *Singleton Pattern* - Used for configuration and data storage
- *Clean Architecture* - Separated concerns with service classes

### Modern Java Features
- *Date/Time API* - Modern date handling (no more struggling with old Date classes!)
- *Enhanced For Loops* - Cleaner iteration through collections
- *String Methods* - Practical usage of split(), trim(), and more

- *JVM* (Virtual Machine) - The magic that makes Java cross-platform

## 🔧 IDE Setup Guide

### Eclipse Users
1. Create a new Java project
2. Set up packages: edu.ccrm.cli, edu.ccrm.domain, etc.
3. Copy source files to appropriate packages
4. Add the test-data folder to project root
5. Run CCRMApp.java - you should see the main menu!

### IntelliJ IDEA Users
1. New Project → Java
2. Create package structure
3. Import source files
4. Add test-data folder
5. Run the main class

## 📚 Learning Path

*Beginner Level:*
1. Explore the domain classes (Student, Course, Person)
2. Understand inheritance with Person → Student/Instructor
3. See encapsulation with private fields and public methods

*Intermediate Level:*
1. Study the service classes for business logic
2. Learn file I/O with ImportExportService
3. Understand the Singleton pattern in AppConfig

*Advanced Level:*
1. Examine exception handling strategies
2. Explore recursion in file utilities
3. See how modern Date/Time API works
